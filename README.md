# Data-cleaning-Pandas

In this repository you can find a project that deals with data cleaning by applying different methods and its analysis and subsequent visualization. The goal is to demonstrate if the hypotheses formulated are true.
The data has been obtained from Kaggle and its theme is the shark attack. 
The repository is divided into several folders containing the following files:

1. README
2. "Cleaning_data.ipynb" : in this file the cleaning methods are applied. The functions that are applied are obtained from the file.
3. "Visualization.ipynb": in this file the data are visualized by means of graphics, using seaborn. 

Folder src:
"data_extraction.py": in this file are the functions used for data cleaning. 
4. "visualization_functions.py": the purpose of this file was to contain the functions used for data visualization, but in this case, it was not necessary to use any functions. 

The following libraries have been imported: 
    pandas 
    numpy 
    re
    seaborn 
    matplotlib


These are the hypotheses that have been formulated:

 H1 : Most fatal shark attacks occur in men.

 H2.  Most attacks occur in Oceania and South Africa on surfers.

 H3. Great white sharks are responsible for most of the attacks occurring in Oceania.

CONCLUSIONS:

 H1 : The hypothesis is confirmed. Most fatal shark attacks occur in men.

 H2.  Thanks to the graphs we can appreciate that most shark attacks occur in North America followed by Oceania. The hypothesis is wrong.

 H3. As the graph shows, the majority of shark attacks in Oceania are from white sharks. The hypothesis is confirmed.
