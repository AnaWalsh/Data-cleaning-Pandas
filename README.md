## Goal üèÅ

In this repository you can find a project that deals with data cleaning by applying different methods and its analysis and subsequent visualization. 

The data has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) and its theme is Shark Attacks. 

## Structure of the project files 

The repository is divided into several folders containing the following files:

- **Cleaning_data.ipynb**: in this file the cleaning methods are applied. The functions that are applied are obtained from the file.
- **Visualization.ipynb**: in this file data is visualized by means of graphics, using seaborn. 
- **Folder src:**

    **data_extraction.py**: in this file are the functions used for data cleaning. 

    **visualization_functions.py**: the purpose of this file was to contain the functions used for data visualization, but in this case, it was not necessary to use any functions. 

## Working plan

**1.Three hypotheses are formulated:**

**H1:** Most fatal shark attacks occur to men.

**H2:** Most attacks occur in Oceania and South Africa to surfers.

**H3:** Great white sharks are responsible for most of the attacks occurring in Oceania.

**2.Explore and clean data**

**3.Data visualization and conlusions**

 H1: The hypothesis is confirmed. Most fatal shark attacks occur to men.

 H2:  Thanks to the graphs we can appreciate that most shark attacks occur in North America followed by Oceania. The hypothesis is wrong.

 H3. As the graph shows, the majority of shark attacks in Oceania are from white sharks. The hypothesis is confirmed.

## Libraries üìö
 
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## To do

- Automating some parts of the code to avoid highly repetitive parts.
